what we have:
3 independent measures:
(1) Actuals (selected year actuals)
(2) vs Last Year (TY vs PY Actuals)
(3) % to Revenue (TY vs PY Actuals %)

what want to achieve:
have a filter with multiple options, when choose any of the option, the corresponding column will present in the table

new measure
Annual Totals = 
SWITCH( TRUE(),
    [Table Data] = "Actuals", [Selected Year Actuals],
    [Table Data] = "vs Last Year", [TY vs PY Actuals],
    [Table Data] = "% to Revenue", [TY vs PY Actuals %],
      Blank() ) 
# Blank() here ensure always be something
