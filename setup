lookup table
fact table
supporting table
Date table
******************************************************************************************************************* create date table
create Date table by code:
copy date table code - home - new source - blank query - advanced editor - paste code
window pops out - request to input StartDate, EndDate and FYStartMonth

******************************************************************************************************************* group tables
still in data transformation before load tables into power bi
check column names in tables
check data types for columns in tables

add new column
Add Column - Column From Examples - Q1 - change column name to Quarters
******************************************************************************************************************* unpivot
pivoted raw tables are useless in power bi

Transform - Use First Row as Headers

select columns you want to maintain and right click and click Unpivot Other Columns

after unpivot, in the table, we will have column Year, not filter this table by the column in the table but by another table which is date table
so need a column in this table to link up with date table

******************************************************************************************************************* inactive relationship
invocie table has two columns that are both date
link date table with these two columns separately, and one would be active relationship, and make it inactive why??? aged trial balance

******************************************************************************************************************* many to many
cash flow data table year column links to date table year column
This relationship has cardinality Many-Many. This should only be used if it is expected that neither column (Year and Year)
contains unique values, and that the significantly different behaviour of Many-many relationships is understood.

avoid this kind of relationships, instead, we can create virutal relationship by Dax to achieve what we want

******************************************************************************************************************* union two tables
combine sales and company expenses tables together into one table, which contains all the info we need to build income statement

measure
Total Sales = SUM( Sales[Revenue])

how to roll up revenue, we have different segments of revenue?
how many revenue per month per channel?

create a new table (to be similar to expense table)
Channel Revenues = 
SUMMARIZE( Sales, Sales[Channel], Dates[Month&Year],
    "Category", "Revenue",
    "First Date", MIN( Dates[Date]),
    "Sales Values", [Total Sales])

combine:
create another new table
Income Statement Data = 
UNION('Company Expenses', 
      SUMMARIZE( ' Channel Revenues', 'Channel Revenues'[Channel], 'Channel Revenues'[Category], 'Channel Revenues'[First Date], 'Channel Revenues[Sales Values]))

key takeaway: you need to find a way to integrate all of that information that in particular statement into the same table
simpler to put it into our template later
